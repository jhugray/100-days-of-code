# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Thoughts**: <3 React

## Day 2: June 16 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed some React on Codecademy, in particular using state. Completed a small React project to create a random color with a button click.

**Thoughts**: Even though I've built projects with React before, it's always good to get a refresher on how props, state, super(props), setState, and this work in React.

## Day 3: June 17 Friday

**Today's Progress**: 2 algorithm challenges on Coderbytes. 

**Thoughts**: I definitely need to work on algorithms more. I got there in the end, but it was a  struggle - and they just instill a sense of anxiety in me that I don't get when building something. I think it's the "test" like feel. Oh well - it's exciting to have something to work on as I am sure if I keep practicing I will learn a ton and see improvements! 

I am only planning on doing the challenge Monday - Friday to ensure I am available and present for/with my family. I'm excited to get back to things next week!

## Day 4: June 20 Monday

**Today's Progress**: I went back to an old project, reviewed my old code, and began to make some improvements to the css. I plan on working on this project more this week and used today to refamiliarize myself with it. 

**Thoughts**: I don't love the look of this project. I'm going to get make some functional improvements and then may do a total front end rehaul.

## Day 5: June 21 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I made it so user input will be saved by hitting enter, or clicking the save button. I also began to implement a new feature - Goals - a list of high priority to-do's. 

**Thoughts**: Due to illness (my own and my family's) I had to take a step back from coding - but it feels so good to be back building something!

## Day 6: June 22 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Working on CRUD routes for a new feature in my project, Goals. The update/put route needs some more work but the rest are working well after some testing in Insomnia. 

**Thoughts**: Although I'd love to just hook up the new routes into the front end right away, I see the benefit from testing them in Insomnia first and playing around there.

## Day 7: June 23 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I attended Front-End Test Fest - an event talking about front end testing, frameworks, and accessibility. 

**Thoughts**: I took a lot away from the accessibility component. There are a lot of resources around accessibility and accessibility testing I plan on using in my future work. I tested a current project which identified areas where I can improve upon and I'm excited to incorporate the recommendations to make my project accessible.

## Day 8: June 27 Monday

**Today's Progress**: I ran accessability audits on my Cherryplanner app and refactored to meet the WCAG 2.1 level AA. The capp went from semi complianct to compliant! 

**Thoughts**: I want to continue to think about a11y as I code.

## Day 9: June 29 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I got the backend API routes for a new feature in my project completed, and begun to bring them to the front end. Today was a short day as I am busy with family commitments. 

**Thoughts**: Not a super productive day but I really enjoyed the coding time I had.
